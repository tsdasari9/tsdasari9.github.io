        <h3 class = "description">
            I am hoping to study Computer Science with a focus on Civic Technology in college. 
            I am especially interested in using Computing powers for social good.
            Throughout high school, I have been involved in Youth and Government, and this year's Secretary of the State. 
            From this experience, I learned how important it is for each of us to be committed to our communities and use our voices to make a change. 
            I want to combine this with my love for technology to become a software engineer and leader to develop tools that positively impact the world.
